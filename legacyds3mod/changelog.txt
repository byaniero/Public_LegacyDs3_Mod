Things I changed in ds3 currently
-------------------------------------

added Legacy Poise (needs exhaustive testing)
(ceiling then 2x multiplier of vanilla poise value)
added Weight Class Defense (needs exhaustive testing)
(4 classes based on weight <2,<5,<10,10+)
increased damage of heavy attacks 1.1x
increased 2h attack damage 1.1x


Max hp multiplier 1.1 (tested but not entirely satisfied)
mp regen -1 (mostly untested)
souls multiplier 1.35 (this feels about right)
Item discovery vastly increased (needs testing)

things to potentially add
--------------------------
-decrease r1 stagger damage
-make poison not suck
-remove some bonfires
-change lighting on boring af areas
-change some dickweed enemy placements (specifics to come)
-remove the necessity for the life ring (long term, may never happen)
