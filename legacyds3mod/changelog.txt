-allow more ammunitions to be carried
-Reworked Bows, Greatbows, Crossbows

-make poison no longer sucks

things to potentially add
--------------------------

-consider buffing fire arrows...they suck
-buff whips (they suck)
-try to remove nudity debuff
-make it possible to get covenant items (decrease cost, or increase found or dropped) (test with item discovery)(can be easily done in ItemLotParam)
-remove some bonfires (I know how >:)  )
-change lighting on boring af areas (dunno how) (try incandescent reshade)
-change some dickweed enemy placements (specifics to come)
-add more fun enemies to fight in boring areas
-remove the necessity for the life ring (long term, may never happen)
-decrease r1 stagger damage (dunno how)
-make parrying a little easier (definitely requires animation edits) (reduce stamina/hp damage on partial parries)
-slow down estus recovery (contacted CornflakeRush) (probably requires animation edits)
